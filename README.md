# Data Mining Project - Credit Card Fraud Detection and Prediction using R
Investigates the performance of Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) using H2O, Support Vector Machine, k-nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest in predicting the fraud transactions in a highly imbalanced data of credit card transactions in September 2013 by European cardholders. Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed on the masked and PCA transformed features. Based on the insights from the EDA, three models were executed which resulted in high performance in predicting the fraud transaction in the test set.

## Tasks Breakdown
The tasks for the project include:

- Determining a dataset that is both significant and valuable enough to add value to the real world problem

- A look at the business questions that the project is trying to answer
  * The background of fraud transaction and why it is becoming problematic
  * The description of our dataset and how our project help understand the fraud transactions

- Preparing the dataset, including:
  * Introduction to the credit card transaction fraud dataset
  * Check the missing data 
  * Check the repetitive data
  * Cleanse the missing data
  
- A thorough EDA for the dataset, including:
  * Transform the target variable from continuous variable to categorical variable (0 and 1 to 'Not Fraud' and 'Fraud')
  * Transform the transaction time variable from number of seconds elapsed to hours in a day, then converted the hours into day and night
  * Look into multivariable correlation
  * Analyze original variables
  * Analyze masked variables, from a macro level to a micro level
  * Recommend the variables that could be useful for predicting the fraud
  
- Adapting machine learning modeling for the dataset, including:
  * A Random Forest modela
  * A Gradiant Boosting model
  * A K-Nearest Neighbor model
  * Model assessment individually, including ROC curve, confusion matrix, and evaluation of variable importance
  * Model comparison on sensitivity rate

- Recommendations on how our project help understand the frand transaction

- Takeaways for learning data science and machine learning
